> A simple REST Microservice abstracting the consumption of a generative model for images of a recipe.
> This provides stylistic representations of the recipe prompt and implements some prod-ready features.

## 🤖 Features

**This is still a work in progress but currently supports simple recipe and ingredient management.**

> The main goal of this project is providing an easy to deploy, maintain, and consumable model.
> The model aims to provide consistently styled results, so that they are themed. These are also stylistic,
> and not a pure representation of the real recipe.

- Rate limiting to avoid overloading the server 🐇.
- REST service with Swagger spec `{ ... }`.
